## Introduction 

This application was designed to showcase an interactive navigation bar featuring multiple layers of grids in the navigation bar dropdown. The example used in this application is the Gro Intelligence website. The application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Functionality

The navbar is designed to display a dropdown grid of different items when the user hovers the mouse cursor over either the Products tab or the Industries tab. Buttons and links also change color palletes when user hovers over them. Images under the Industries tab zoom with a smooth animation upon hover. This application was written with responsive web design in mind and will change certain displays when the window size changes.

## Installation

No installation is required to run this application. Simply open the index.html file in a browser. For best user experience please use Chrome.
